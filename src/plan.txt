1. create frontend with blank page, allows user to click which will open tagging bar and box outline
2. add wally image, when user clicks coordinates will need to be passed in, check locally if the coordinates are within the image and correct
if character is at coords, map over characters in navbar check which characters are found: true and hide ones which are found


3. add backend coordinates, layout of db will be something like:
 {items:
    {name: wally
    clicked: no/yes
    coordinates: 123x, 345y
    }
    {name: magician
    clicked: no/yes
    coordinates: 123x, 345y
    }
 
 }
4. when user clicks and selects a character check with backend whether the coordinates match
