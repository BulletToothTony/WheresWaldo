1. create frontend with blank page, allows user to click which will open tagging bar and box outline
2. add wally image, when user clicks coordinates will need to be passed in, check locally if the coordinates are within the image and correct
if character is at coords, map over characters in navbar check which characters are found: true and hide ones which are found


3. add backend coordinates, layout of db will be something like:
 {items:
    {name: wally
    clicked: no/yes
    coordinates: 123x, 345y
    }
    {name: magician
    clicked: no/yes
    coordinates: 123x, 345y
    }
 
 }
4. when user clicks and selects a character check with backend whether the coordinates match
5. Now that have backend checking where if users clicks, I need to set the db so it registers where the character is found as true / false.
e.g. name: wally,
     found: false,

when user clicks wally, will change to:
      name: wally,
      found: true,

When found is set to true will also update some of the classes locally, not sure if I need to do all of the above steps for 5.

6. Add timer which when all characters are found adds a user to the DB with their time and name.
7. Add reset button.
